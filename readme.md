# The Java programming language

A short repo of Java programming language sample programs. 

- [01 - Hello World](/src/com/irisida/helloworld/HelloWorld.java) - The standard `Hello World` introductory program as is customary in any new language, or old language. 
- [02 - Temperature Conversion](/src/com/irisida/tempconvert/TempConvert.java) - Another classic example is the convertor, here we have celsius and fahrenheit being converted by means of passing an input value to a method. Here we have a naive handling and not particularly resilient to erroneous input (more on that later).
- [03 - The While loop](/src/com/irisida/whileloop/WhileLoop.java) - Very brief introduction to looping using a `while` construct.
