# The Java programming language - Chapter 3


- [1.3.1 - The While loop](/src/com/irisida/lang/part01/chapter03/whileloop/WhileLoop.java) - Very brief introduction to looping using a `while` construct.
- [1.3.2 - The for loop](/src/com/irisida/lang/part01/chapter03/forloop/ForLoop.java) - Simplest `for loop` example.
- [1.3.3 - The do-while loop](/src/com/irisida/lang/part01/chapter03/dowhile/DoWhile.java)  A very simple exercise demonstrating the `do while` loop construct. We see here that a do-while has an execution guarantee to always run at least once based on the loop evaluation being at the tail of the loop rather that at the head.
- [1.3.4 - loops with Stream](/src/com/irisida/lang/part01/chapter03/loopstream/LoopStream.java) - Introduction to streams and the syntax of these more advanced concepts to be covered in depth later on.
