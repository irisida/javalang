# The Java programming language - Chapter 1

- [1.1.1 - Hello World](/src/com/irisida/lang/part01/basics/helloworld/HelloWorld.java) - The standard `Hello World` introductory program as is customary in any new language, or old language. All we aim to learn here is how to show some output from a java program.
- [1.1.2 - Temperature Conversion](/src/com/irisida/lang/part01/basics/tempconvert/TempConvert.java) - Another classic example is the convertor, here we have celsius and fahrenheit being converted by means of passing an input value to a method. Here we have a naive handling and not particularly resilient to erroneous input (more on that later).
