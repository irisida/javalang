# The Java programming language - Part Two - Arrays, multidimensional arrays and streams.

- [2.01 - Simple arrays](/src/com/irisida/lang/part02/arrays/simplearrays/SimpleArrays.java) - An introductory example to declaring arrays in Java.
- [2.02 - String type arrays](/src/com/irisida/lang/part02/arrays/stringarrays/StringArrays.java) - Arrays using the string type, some iteration and array mutation with an intro to zero indexing as per almost all common programming languages.
- [2.03 - Arrays and streams iteration](/src/com/irisida/lang/part02/arrays/streamarrays/StreamArrays.java) - Here we're using the streams syntax to iterate across an array using the `range` and `.forEach`.
- [2.04 - Using for each iteration with arrays](/src/com/irisida/lang/part02/arrays/foreach/ForEach.java) - A syntax demo of the for each loop. This is a common syntax and is fairly ubiquitous in java projects. The construct is clean and avoids some syntactic noise, the downside is that you have no access to the index of the loop. If the index is required you're better off sticking to a traditional `for loop`.
- [2.05 - Multidimensional arrays](/src/com/irisida/lang/part02/arrays/multidim/MultiDim.java) - Basic demo of an Array of arrays. A multidimensional array. Demos that the arrays need not be exactly the same size, only the type is fixed.
- [2.06 - More Multidimensional arrays](/src/com/irisida/lang/part02/arrays/moremultidim/MoreMultiDim.java) - reduced the code footprint and works with the `[][]` notation to achieve multidimensional handling in less code.
