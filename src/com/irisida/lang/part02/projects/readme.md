# The Java programming language

Throughout the course there are some projects to build. These correspond to those sections.

- [KCP.01 - Hangman](/src/com/irisida/lang/part02/projects/hangman) - Implements a small hangman game. The program is made from three files, the main class, a Hangman class and a RandomWord class. Implements the concepts of handling string input, handling input to char conversion, lookup, answer masking, state update after guesses and is gamified by limiting tries.
- [KCP.02 - Bingo](/src/com/irisida/lang/part02/projects/bingo) - Implements a trivial bingo game, on a 4*4 grid. Winning scenarios: `full house`.
- [KCP.03 - Rock, Paper, Scissors](/src/com/irisida/lang/part02/projects/rockpaperscissors) - Implements the classic game of Rock, paper, scissors! Some limitations were left in place given the place in the course we're at this stage. These include the omission of any try-catch mechanism and decent error handling of user input, so program requires the `happy path` currently.
