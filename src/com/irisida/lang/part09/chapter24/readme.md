# The Java programming language - Chapter 24

Reading, writing and parsing binary files

- [9.24.1 - Writing a binary file](/src/com/irisida/lang/part09/chapter24/writetobinaryfile/App.java) - An example of writing out to a binary file. Here we have created a `byte[]` array and we write it to file.
- [9.24.2 - Reading from binary file](/src/com/irisida/lang/part09/chapter24/readingbinaryfiles/App.java) - Capitalising on the previous example here we're reading the file that was written into a byte array and traversing the array to console the output.
- [9.24.3 - Reading a Java class file](/src/com/irisida/lang/part09/chapter24/readclassfile/App.java) - Demo of reading a java class file. Shows the `cafebabe` easter egg in Java.
