# The Java programming language - Chapter 14

- [5.14.1 - Using inner classes to handle swing events](/src/com/irisida/lang/part05/chapter14/swinginnerclases) - Here we have taken the previous section Swing program and updated it to use inner classes. We have the objects implementing the ColorChangeListener interface and use inner classes to achieve a more simpler solution with less references flying about in the [ToolBar](/src/com/irisida/lang/part05/chapter14/swinginnerclases/ToolBar.java).
- [5.14.2 - Introducing lambda expressions to handle swing events](/src/com/irisida/lang/part05/chapter14/swingandlambda) - Here we have taken the inner classes and converted the usage of them to lambda expressions which drastically reduces code and simplifies it, for those from a functional background.
