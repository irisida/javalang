# The Java programming language - Chapter 13

- [5.13.1 - Hashcode and This](/src/com/irisida/lang/part05/chapter13/hashcodethis) - Here we can see the hashcode that is associated with the creation of an object. We also highlight the appearance/use of this in the default toString that is associated with any object we create without overriding the toString method. We need to demonstrate this using `Printf()` and defining the `%h` format as the `Println()` default is to use decimal format.
- [5.13.2 - Inner class basic example](/src/com/irisida/lang/part05/chapter13/innerclassexample/App.java) - Here we can see the declaration and utilisation of an inner class. The example has an inner class that implements the runnable interface and that means we can use it with the concurrent packages Executors to create a timer.
- [5.13.3 - Effectively final](/src/com/irisida/lang/part05/chapter13/effectivelyfinal/App.java) - Here we demonstrate the notion of `effectively final` where we can have an inner class access variables from within the methods of an outer class as long as they are not mutated. A feature that whilst it works it could prompt a loss of clarity of cleaning up compile time errors on silly mistakes where a change in the code sees a variable that was effectively final is subject to mutation meaning we now have to change code in multiple places.
- [5.13.4 - Static inner classes](/src/com/irisida/lang/part05/chapter13/staticinnerclass/Person.java) - Trivial example of declaring static inner classes. Although nonsensical it demos the ability to house classes within the classes we declare.
- [5.13.5 - Non-static inner classes](/src/com/irisida/lang/part05/chapter13/nonstaticinnerclasses/Person.java) - Here we demonstrate a non=static inner class. The difference is that non-static inner classes can refer to instance variables because they are non-static and therefore are reliant on and associated with a particular instance.
