# The Java programming language - Chapter 17

In this chapter we'll look at more exception and deal with multiple exceptions.

- [7.17.1 - Handling exceptions with multiple exceptions](src/com/irisida/lang/part07/chapter17/multipleexceptions) - Here we have a demo that uses a hierarchy of exception classes we have created.
- [7.17.2 - Using subclass polymorphism with multiple exceptions]() - We're expending on the code from the previous demo to show how we can simplify the code by using the baselcass exception in a subclass polymorphic way to reduce the footprint an improve clarity.
