# The Java programming language - Chapter 15

Enums are another high level type in Java where effectively we are managing lists of the exact same thing, differing only in minute detail, eg, Colors (red, green blue), all colors!

- [6.15.1 - First enum example](/src/com/irisida/lang/part06/chapter15/firstenum) - A walkthrough of creating an `enum`. Here we've used fruits, therefore we can call the `Fruit` enum like we were calling a class.
- [6.15.2 - Enum utilities methods and loops](/src/com/irisida/lang/part06/chapter15/enumutils) - Here we show how to iterate an enum using a for each loop and how to do comparison.
- [6.15.3 - How to use constructors for an enum](/src/com/irisida/lang/part06/chapter15/withconstructor) - Here we can see how to add additional attributes to an enum via the constructor.
- [6.15.4 - Enums and the switch statement](/src/com/irisida/lang/part06/chapter15/withswitch) - Here we show how to use an enum.value in a switch construct.
